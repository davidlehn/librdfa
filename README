librdfa - The Fastest RDFa Parser on the Internet
-------------------------------------------------

librdfa is a C-based RDFa parser for XML family languages. 
It currently supports XHTML+RDFa 1.0.

Building and running librdfa
----------------------------

Change into the librdfa directory (the same directory that contains
this README.txt file).

  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/libs
  ./tests/dist/speed 

If everything goes well, the speed test should show you being able to
process roughly 10k triples/sec.


Development
-----------

pkg-config support is provided to setup cflags and libs. The .pc file is
installed along with development files. Add the librdfa source dir to
the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment var to use the uninstalled library.

Building a simple program using librdfa pkg-config support:

  cc `pkg-config --libs --cflags librdfa` -o test test.c


Installation
------------

Use configure options to setup install directories.  For more information:

  ./configure --help

To install:

  make install
