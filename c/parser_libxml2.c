 * The librdfa library is the Fastest RDFa Parser in the Universe. It is
 * a stream parser, meaning that it takes an XML data as input and spits
 * out RDF triples as it comes across them in the stream. Due to this
 * processing approach, librdfa has a very, very small memory footprint.
 * It is also very fast and can operate on hundreds of gigabytes of XML
 * data without breaking a sweat.
