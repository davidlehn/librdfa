Description: RDFa parsing C library - runtime library
 The librdfa parser is used to extract RDF triples from XHTML+RDFa documents.
 It uses expat for the underlying XML parser, is very small in size (19KB),
 cross-platform, stream-based, has a very small execution footprint, and
 has bindings to other languages, such as Python.
 .
 This package contains all of the runtime files needed to use the librdfa 
 parser.
